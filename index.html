            <h2>Chapter 1: AI is Everywhere (And You Didn't Even Know It)</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Have you ever wondered how Netflix always seems to know what shows you’ll like? Or how Google’s search results are so spot-on with what you were looking for, even before you finished typing your question? Or maybe how your smartphone can unlock itself just by recognizing your face?</p>

            <p class="intro-text"><strong>These are just a few of the countless everyday examples of artificial intelligence (AI) in action.</strong> But here's the thing: You might not even realize that AI is involved. It’s so integrated into our daily lives that it feels like just another part of the background.</p>

            <p class="intro-text"><strong>AI isn’t some futuristic technology from a sci-fi movie. It’s already here, and it’s helping shape the world we live in today.</strong></p>

            <h3>What Exactly Is AI?</h3>
            <p class="intro-text">At its core, artificial intelligence refers to <strong>machines or software that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence</strong>. This includes things like recognizing speech, identifying objects in images, understanding natural language (like what you’re reading right now), and making decisions based on data.</p>

            <p class="intro-text">In simple terms: AI is about <strong>getting machines to think, learn, and make decisions</strong>—often much faster and more accurately than humans.</p>

            <h3>How Is AI Already Part of Your Life?</h3>
            <ul class="examples-list">
                <li><strong>Smartphones & Virtual Assistants</strong> (Siri, Google Assistant, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Social Media Feeds</strong> (AI-powered recommendations on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)</li>
                <li><strong>Online Shopping Recommendations</strong> (Amazon, eBay)</li>
                <li><strong>Navigation & Traffic</strong> (Google Maps, Waze)</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare</strong> (AI helping doctors analyze X-rays, medical images, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Should You Care?</h3>
            <p class="intro-text">AI is only going to get more integrated into our lives. In fact, it’s already transforming entire industries—from <strong>finance</strong> and <strong>education</strong> to <strong>transportation</strong> and <strong>entertainment</strong>.</p>

            <p class="intro-text">The best part? <strong>You don’t have to be a tech expert to use it</strong>. In fact, AI tools are becoming more and more accessible—so much so that you don’t need to know how to write a line of code to benefit from them.</p>

            <p class="intro-text">In the next chapters, we’ll dive deeper into how AI can <strong>transform your business</strong>, <strong>make your life easier</strong>, and give you a competitive edge. But for now, just remember: <strong>AI is here, and it’s already part of your world.</strong></p>
